//! Data representation of various SPIR-V language constructs.
//!
//! By language constructs, I mean general language concepts like module,
//! function, basic block, instruction, and operands. This is different
//! from the "control flow constructs" mentioned in the SPIR-V
//! [specification](https://goo.gl/YQRcZT).
//!
//! This data representation is designed to be lightweight; there are
//! no excessive sanity check or cross referrences within each language
//! construct. It is intended to be used as a plain data vehicle of
//! SPIR-V language constructs in the memory.
//!
//! Required components of a language construct may still be wrapped around
//! using `Option`; it makes the data representation more flexible since
//! we don't always require valid language constructs.
//!
//! Apart from definitions of various language constructs, this module also
//! provides a [loader](struct.Loader.html) for loading SPIR-V binaries
//! (together with the [parser](../binary/struct.Parser.html)) and a
//! [builder](struct.Builder.html) for building a SPIR-V data representation
//! interactively.
